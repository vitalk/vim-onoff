Vim onoff
=========

Vim has a lot of different boolean options â€” `cursorline`, `number`, `list`,
`spell`, etc. Toggle them *gracefully*.

Plugin provides the `:Onoff` command to switch boolean options in Vim. After
each turn option value shown at bottom of the window.

Feel free to create a handy aliases for most used options:

```viml
nnore <Leader>- :Onoff cursorline<cr>
nnore <Leader>h :Onoff hlsearch<cr>
nnore <Leader>n :Onoff number<cr>
nnore <Leader>p :Onoff paste<cr>
nnore <Leader>s :Onoff spell<cr>
nnore <Leader>i :Onoff list<cr>
```

For those who want to use `:Onoff` command explicitly, `:onoff` abbreviation is
available. Abbreviation works on when 'onoff' is the first word on the command
line. Note that `:Onoff` command has autocompletion for all available boolean
options supported by your Vim distribution.

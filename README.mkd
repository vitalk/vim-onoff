Vim onoff
=========

Vim has a lot of different boolean options â€” `cursorline`, `number`, `list`,
`spell`, etc. Toggle them *gracefully*.

Much of `onoff.vim` was extracted from my `vimrc`. Plugin provides an API to
switch boolean options in Vim. After each turn option value shown at bottom of
the window.

```viml
nnore <Leader>- :Onoff cursorline<cr>
nnore <Leader>h :Onoff hlsearch<cr>
nnore <Leader>n :Onoff number<cr>
nnore <Leader>p :Onoff paste<cr>
nnore <Leader>s :Onoff spell<cr>
nnore <Leader>i :Onoff list<cr>
```

Vim onoff
=========

Vim has a lot of different boolean options â€” `cursorline`, `number`, `list`,
`spell`, etc. Toggle them *gracefully*.

Much of `onoff.vim` was extracted from my `vimrc`. Plugin provides an API to
switch boolean options in Vim. After each turn option value shown at bottom of
the window.

For easy usage plugin exposes some `<Plug>` mappings, feel free to remap it to
something nice:

```viml
nmap <Leader>- <Plug>(onoff-cursorline)
nmap <Leader>h <Plug>(onoff-hlsearch)
nmap <Leader>n <Plug>(onoff-number)
nmap <Leader>p <Plug>(onoff-paste)
nmap <Leader>s <Plug>(onoff-spell)
nmap <Leader>i <Plug>(onoff-list)
```

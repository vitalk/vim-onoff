On/off Vim options.                                                    *onoff*

1. Intro                                                         *onoff-intro*

Vim has a lot of different |options| â€” |'number'|, |'spell'|, |'cursorline'|, etc.
Plugin provides an API to turn them on/off. After each switch option value
shown at bottom of the window.

==============================================================================
2. Commands                                                   *onoff-commands*

Plugin define only one :Onoff command. Feel free to create a handy aliases for
most used options:
>
nnore <Leader>- :Onoff cursorline<cr>
nnore <Leader>h :Onoff hlsearch<cr>
nnore <Leader>n :Onoff number<cr>
nnore <Leader>p :Onoff paste<cr>
nnore <Leader>s :Onoff spell<cr>
nnore <Leader>i :Onoff list<cr>
<

If you want to use :Onoff command explicitly, it's possible to use command
without capitalization, e.g. :onoff abbreviation is available. Abbreviation
works only when 'onoff' is the first word on the command line.

                                                                      *:Onoff*
                                                                      *:onoff*
:Onoff [option]         Switch value of boolean option and show new value at
                        bottom of the window.

                        Note: command has autocompletion for all available
                        boolean options in your Vim distribution.

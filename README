                    on/off boolean options in Vim

    ~ What is it?

      Vim has a lot of different boolean options â€” `cursorline`,
      `number`, `list`, `spell`, etc. Toggle them *gracefully*.

      Plugin provides the `:Onoff` command to switch boolean options
      in Vim. After each turn option value shown at bottom of the
      window.

      Feel free to create a handy aliases for most used options:

      nnore <Leader>n :Onoff number<cr>
      nnore <Leader>p :Onoff paste<cr>
      nnore <Leader>s :Onoff spell<cr>

      For those who want to use `:Onoff` command explicitly, `:onoff`
      abbreviation is available. Abbreviation works on when 'onoff'
      is the first word on the command line.

      Note that `:Onoff` command has autocompletion for all available
      boolean options supported by your Vim distribution.
